// Scope Code

// - My ideia is to have a one page app where the theme is from Star Wars and the user will be able to get some Jedi Wisdom from Master Yoda.

// - Once the page loads they will be prompt to answer two questions: the 1st one would be: "How are you feeling today?" The user would have radion buttons to sleect which one they would like and the otions are, option1 = Rebel / option2 = Dark. The 2nd question would be: "Which lighsaber would you choose?" option1 = Blue / option2 = Red. I would have an image or a gif with the lightsabers beside the radio button. 

// - To randomize the selection of which quote will be displayed I will create two objects arrays, one for Jedi with two key values Red and Blue and inside this values I will have quotes based on if they select Rebel, Red something related to the dark side, if they select Rebel and Blue some good advise from Yoda. I will do the same for the Vader with two key values Red and Blue.

// - Depending on their selection I would have a random quote from Yoda displaying below the two questions and beside Yoda's photo. 

// Strech Goal

// - Increase number of quotes
// - Have the quote shown in a speaking balloon 
// - Animate the header and have Yoda with some sort of animation too
